let's take care of that sucker!

2. All other bugs are tracked as [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Please follow the [issue submission process](#issue-submission-process) detailed below.

### Issue Submission Process

* Before submitting a new issue, check the [issue list](https://github.com/TylerJOtte/Forge/issues) to see if a respective report already exists.
* If there's a matching *open* entry, do not open a new issue. Add a comment to the existing issue instead.
* If there's a matching *closed* entry, open a new issue, and include a link to the closed entry.
* Otherwise, open up a new [issue](https://github.com/TylerJOtte/Forge/issues), and fill out its containing form in sufficient detail. Please appropriately mark the entry in accordance with the project's [label conventions](#label-conventions).

### Security Policies

#### Reporting Security-Related Bugs

**DO NOT** open an issue for security related bugs. Instead, email the project
 maintainer directly at TylerJOtte@icloud.com.

##### How do I know if my report contains a security-related bug?

- [ ] Can you access an item that is not yours?
- [ ] Can you access an item that you are not supposed to have access to?
- [ ] Can you access an item that disables a feature for others?

If you answered "yes" to any of the above questions, the report most likely
contains a security-related bug. If you answered "no" to all questions, but
you're still hesitant, please email the project maintainer directly at TylerJOtte@icloud.com.

All bugs are taken seriously; every effort will be made to address your report.
Thank you for your contribution!
